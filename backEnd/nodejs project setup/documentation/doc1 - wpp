🔍 What is happening here?

await wppconnect.create()	            Creates a session and returns the client instance
catchLinkCode	                        Called when WhatsApp sends a login code to the phone
start(client)	                          Your function where you begin sending messages, getting groups, contacts, etc.



⚠ Why it took long

WPPConnect tries to download Chromium (same as Puppeteer).
This file is 100MB+ so on slow network it takes time.

If you want to skip this (for development on Windows), run:

set PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=true
npm i @wppconnect-team/wppconnect
